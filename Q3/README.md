Lab 2: Question 3
When are tickets most likely to be issued?


Description
Using the NYC Parking Data from 2022, the CSV file will be stripped of all columns that are not the Issue Date. The dates are then counted and the top 20 are printed in descending order.


 Running the Program
Starting from the Virtual Instance root the parking data is stored in the path: /spark-examples/lab2 and the program and test.sh file is stored in the path: /spark-examples/lab2/Question3 under the filename tickets-issued.py
